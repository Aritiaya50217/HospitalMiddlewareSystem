# Hospital Middleware System

Hospital Middleware System is a **production-ready backend service** designed to manage **patients, staff, hospitals, and users** in a hospital ecosystem.  
It is built with **Golang**, **Gin**, **PostgreSQL**, and follows **Clean Architecture** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.

This project demonstrates how to design a **modern backend system** with strong separation of concerns, authentication, and containerized deployment.
